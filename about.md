## Research interests


Currently I am wandering at the overlap between **disordered systems** and **linear sum assignment problems**, studying the typical ground state energy at zero temperature of various **Euclidean assignment problems** and their ''mean field'' approximations, called **random assignment problems**.  
This is also the essential topic of [my master's thesis](downloads/masterthesis.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

<p class="message"><i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>An optimal assignment in dimension D=2 at size n=5000. Each link contributes to the total cost with its Euclidean length, which also defines its color as shown in the key (the endpoints are uniformly distributed in the unit square).</p>
