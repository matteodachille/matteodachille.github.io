## Research interests

Currently I am wandering at the overlap between **disordered systems** and **linear sum assignment problems**, studying the typical ground state energy at zero temperature of various **Euclidean assignment problems** and their ''mean field'' approximations, called **random assignment problems**.  
This is also the essential topic of [my master's thesis](downloads/masterthesis.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
