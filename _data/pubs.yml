  abstract: 'We exhibit an uncountable family of extremal inhomogeneous Gibbs measures of the low temperature Ising model on regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These states arise as low
temperature perturbations of local ground states having a sparse enough set of frustrated edges, the sparseness being measured in terms of the isoperimetric constant of the graph. This result
is implied by an extension of the article [9] on regular trees to non-amenable graphs. We argue how we can deduce the extremality of an uncountable subset of the Series–Sinai states [30] at
low temperature.'

  abstract: 'We characterize the set of finite shapes with minimal perimeter on hyperbolic lattices given by regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane whose tiles are regular \(p\)-gons meeting at vertices of degree \( q\), with \(\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}< \frac{1}{2} \). The main tool is a layer decomposition due to Rietman-Nienhuis-Oitmaa and Moran, which allows us to prove convergence towards the Cheeger constant when these shapes exhaust the lattice. Furthermore, we apply a celebrated result of Floyd-Plotnick, which will allow us to compute the Euler characteristic for these graphs in terms of certain growth functions and the number of \( n \)-sized animals on those lattices.'

We prove that its law is invariant under all isometries of this space and study some geometric features of its cells. Among other things, we prove that the set of points at equal separation to any two corona points is unbounded almost surely. This is analogous to a recent result of Frączyk-Mellick-Wilkens for higher rank symmetric spaces.'

In contrast to the Euclidean setting, a limiting nontrivial ideal tessellation \( \mathcal{V}_{d} \) appears as the intensity tends to \(0\). The tessellation \(  \mathcal{V}_{d} \) is  a natural, isometry-invariant decomposition of \( \mathbb{H}_{d} \) into countably many unbounded polytopes, each with a unique end.  We study its basic properties, in particular, the geometric features of its cells.'

The mechanism rests on the occurrence of a spin-flop transition with a broken discrete symmetry, once the model is constrained by the decimated spins in a suitably chosen "bad" configuration.'

 of unit area. It is known that the average cost scales as \( E_\Omega(N) \sim 1/2\pi \ln N \) with a correction that is at most of order \( \sqrt{\ln N \ln \ln N} \). In this paper, we show that, within the linearization approximation of the field-theoretical formulation of the problem, the first \( \Omega \)-dependent correction is on the constant term, and can be exactly computed from the spectrum of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on \( \Omega \). We perform the explicit calculation of this constant for various families of surfaces, and compare our predictions with extensive numerics.'

  abstract: 'We consider models of assignment for random \( N \) blue points and \( N \) red points on an interval of length \( 2N \), in which the cost for connecting a blue point in \( x \) to a red point in \( y\)  is the concave function \(|x-y|^p\) , for \( 0<p<1 \). Contrarily to the convex case \( p>1\), where the optimal matching is trivially determined, here the optimization is non-trivial. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a special configuration, that we call the _Dyck matching_, and to study its statistical properties. We compute exactly the average cost, in the asymptotic limit of large \( N \), together with the first subleading correction. The scaling is remarkable: it is of order \( N \) for \( p < \frac{1}{2} \), order \( N\ln N \) for \( p = \frac{1}{2}\), and \( N^{\frac{1}{2}+p} \) for \( p > \frac{1}{2} \), and it is universal for a wide class of models. We conjecture that the average cost of the Dyck matching has the same scaling in \( N \) as the cost of the optimal matching, and we produce numerical data in support of this conjecture. We hope to produce a proof of this claim in future work.'

The cost of the matching is supposed to be dependent on a power \(p>1\) of the Euclidean distance of the matched pairs. We discuss an integral expression for the average optimal cost for \(N \gg 1 \) that generalizes a previous result obtained for \(p=2\). We also study the possible divergence the given expression due to the vanishing of the probability density function. The provided regularization recipe allows us to recover the proper scaling law for the cost in the divergent cases, and possibly some of the involved coefficients. The possibility that the support of \( \varrho \) is a disconnected interval is also analysed. We exemplify the proposed procedure and we compare our predictions with the results of numerical simulations.'

We analytically obtain the average optimal cost in the asymptotic regime of very large number of points \( N \) and some correlation functions for a cost function in the form \( c(z)=z^p \), both in the \(p>1\) case and in the \( p<0 \) case. The scaling of the optimal mean cost with the number of points is \( N^{-p/2} \) for the assignment and \( N^{-p} \) for the matching when \( p>1 \), whereas in both cases it is a constant when \( p<0 \). Finally, our predictions are compared with the results of numerical simulations.'
