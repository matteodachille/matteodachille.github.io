  abstract: 'We study Poisson--Voronoi percolation and its discrete analogue Bernoulli--Voronoi percolation in spaces with a non-amenable product structure. We develop a new method of proving smallness of the uniqueness threshold \(p_u(\lambda)\) at small intensities \(\lambda>0\) based on the unbounded borders phenomenon of their underlining ideal Poisson--Voronoi tessellation. We apply our method to several concrete examples in both the discrete and the continuum setting, including \(k\)-fold graph products of \(d\)-regular trees for \(k\ge2,d\ge3\) and products of hyperbolic spaces \(\mathbb H_{d_1}\times \ldots \times \mathbb H_{d_k}\) for \(k\ge2, d_i\ge2\), complementing a recent result of the second and fourth author for symmetric spaces of connected higher rank semisimple real Lie groups with property (T). We also provide new examples of non-amenable Cayley graphs with the FIID sparse unique infinite cluster property, answering positively a recent question of Pete and Rokob.'

  abstract: 'We exhibit an uncountable family of extremal inhomogeneous Gibbs measures of the low–temperature Ising model on regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These states arise as low temperature perturbations of local ground states having a sparse enough set of frustrated edges, the sparseness being measured in terms of the isoperimetric constant of the graph. This result is implied by an extension of the article [5] about spin models on regular trees to Ising models on a more general class of regular non-amenable graphs. We moreover argue how we can deduce the extremality of an uncountable subset of the Series–Sinai states [24] at low temperature.'

The main tool is a layer decomposition due to Rietman-Nienhuis-Oitmaa and Moran, which allows us to prove convergence towards the Cheeger constant when these shapes exhaust the lattice. Furthermore, we apply a celebrated result of Floyd-Plotnick, which will allow us to compute the Euler characteristic for these graphs in terms of certain growth functions and the number of \( n \)-sized animals on those lattices.'

In this paper, we show that, within the linearization approximation of the field-theoretical formulation of the problem, the first \( \Omega \)-dependent correction is on the constant term, and can be exactly computed from the spectrum of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on \( \Omega \). We perform the explicit calculation of this constant for various families of surfaces, and compare our predictions with extensive numerics.'

  abstract: 'We consider models of assignment for random \( N \) blue points and \( N \) red points on an interval of length \( 2N \), in which the cost for connecting a blue point in \( x \) to a red point in \( y\)  is the concave function \(|x-y|^p\) , for \( 0<p<1 \). Contrarily to the convex case \( p>1\), where the optimal matching is trivially determined, here the optimization is non-trivial. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a special configuration, that we call the _Dyck matching_, and to study its statistical properties. We compute exactly the average cost, in the asymptotic limit of large \( N \), together with the first subleading correction. The scaling is remarkable: it is of order \( N \) for \( p < \frac{1}{2} \), order \( N\ln N \) for \( p = \frac{1}{2}\), and \( N^{\frac{1}{2}+p} \) for \( p > \frac{1}{2} \), and it is universal for a wide class of models. We conjecture that the average cost of the Dyck matching has the same scaling in \( N \) as the cost of the optimal matching, and we produce numerical data in support of this conjecture. We hope to produce a proof of this claim in future work.'

The cost of the matching is supposed to be dependent on a power \(p>1\) of the Euclidean distance of the matched pairs. We discuss an integral expression for the average optimal cost for \(N \gg 1 \) that generalizes a previous result obtained for \(p=2\). We also study the possible divergence the given expression due to the vanishing of the probability density function. The provided regularization recipe allows us to recover the proper scaling law for the cost in the divergent cases, and possibly some of the involved coefficients. The possibility that the support of \( \varrho \) is a disconnected interval is also analysed. We exemplify the proposed procedure and we compare our predictions with the results of numerical simulations.'
