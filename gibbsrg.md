<ins>In brief</ins>: in mathematical statistical mechanics phenomena such as phase transitions and conceptual frameworks such as the renormalization group can be approached rigorously. A central object in this domain are Gibbs mesures and their generalizations, which extend the canonical ensemble of the classical Gibbs theory at finite volume to infinite systems. In order to model phase transitions, one can construct probability measures on an infinite product probability space in an alternative way to the standard Kolmogorov construction which avoids the thermodynamic limit of intensive quantities and takes into account the non-unicity (because there can be more than one Gibbs measure for an infinite system). This rigorous alternative "DLR" construction has been introduced at the end of the sixties by Dobrushin in the East and Lanford-Ruelle in the West and uses systems of compatible conditional probabilities with respect to the exterior of finite subsets, when the boundary conditions are fixed to then directly reach quantities of interest at infinite volume.
  Within this context we are currently focusing on aspects of the renormalization group in lattice systems, such as for nearest neighbors and long-range Ising and planar rotator models at low lattice dimensions and Ising models on Cayley trees.
