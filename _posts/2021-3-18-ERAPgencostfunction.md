During a recent talk of mine for [ALEA Days 2021](http://gt-alea.math.cnrs.fr/alea2021/) (see [here](/assets/ALEA2021_MZSVs_ERAP_final.pdf) for slides), NathanaÃ«l Enriquez asked in which generality one can hope to obtain _nice_ and _exact_ formulas for the expected ground state energy in the one dimensional ERAP in the convex regime for \\(n\\), \\(\sim U(0,1)\\) blue and red points.

Here, _exact_ means valid at any fixed \\(n\\), and _nice_ means that the formula can be written without the explicit use of hypergeometric functions. This question started a discussion involving also Andrea Sportiello. A general argument in this direction can be made based on a connection with generalized Selberg integrals discovered by _Caracciolo et al._ (see [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/ab11d7)). In that paper, the authors have shown that the \\(k\\)-th edge contributes to the total energy through the possibly intimidating expression (see [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/ab11d7), eq. 2.4)
\\[
M_{p,k,n}= \frac{\Gamma^2(n+1)\Gamma(k+\frac{p}{2})\Gamma(n-k+1+\frac{p}{2})\Gamma(1+p)}{\Gamma(k)\Gamma(n-k+1)\Gamma(n+1+\frac{p}{2})\Gamma(n+1+p)\Gamma(1+\frac{p}{2})}.
\\]

This result allowed the authors to show that, for the usual choice of cost function \\(D^p\\) for \\(D\\) euclidean distance, if \\(p\geq 1\\),
\\[
E(n) = n\frac{\Gamma \left(1+\frac{p}{2}\right)}{p+1} \frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{\Gamma \left(n+1+\frac{p}{2}\right)},
\\]
where \\(\Gamma \\) is Euler's function.

The question is thus whether one can provide a cost function \\(f\\) admitting a series representation which plays nicely with the moments, so that a sufficiently simple expression for \\(E(n)\\) can be obtained via resummation.


As of today, the following cost functions have been considered :

- \\(f(r) =\cosh{r}\\)
- \\(f(r) =J_0(r)\\) (Bessel function of order 0)
