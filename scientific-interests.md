I am interested in rigourous statistical mechanics, in particular in its relationship to graph theory and related variational problems, from both analytical and numerical point of view.  
My favourite Monte Carlo toolset is made of C++ for algorithms, BASH for I-O and gnuplot for data analysis.   
Currently I am studying at the overlap between **disordered systems** and **linear sum assignment problems** with a particular focus on the typical ground state energies at zero temperature of various **Euclidean assignment problems** and their ''mean field'' approximations, called **random assignment problems**.  
This is also the essential topic of [my master's thesis](downloads/masterthesis.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

<p class="message"><i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>An optimal assignment in dimension D=2 at size n=5000. Each link contributes to the total cost with its Euclidean length, which also defines its color as shown in the key (the endpoints are uniformly distributed in the unit square).</p>
