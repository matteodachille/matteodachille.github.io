I work in rigourous statistical mechanics, in particular in its relationship to graph theory and related variational problems, from both analytical and numerical point of view. 

A lot of fundamental questions about properties of physical systems with random interactions are far from being answered satisfactorily. In these systems, where typical information is known on the nature of their interactions, there is often lack of even the most common symmetries, that are restored only on average. Numerical insights play a fundamental role in exploring such systems and of course on testing theoretical predictions. 

Currently I am studying two flavours of the **linear sum assignment problem**, the **random assignment problem** and the **Euclidean bipartite matching problem**. 

This is also the essential topic of [my master's thesis](downloads/masterthesis.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

Each link contributes to the total cost with its Euclidean length, which determines its color as shown in the key.</p>
