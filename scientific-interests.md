Currently I'm working in statistical mechanics, in particular on the relationship between disordered and frustrated systems and classes of combinatorial optimisation problems from both analytical and numerical point of view.

A lot of fundamental questions about properties of physical systems with quenched disorder are far from being answered satisfactorily. In these systems, where typical information is known on the nature of their interactions, there is often lack of even the most common symmetries, that are restored only on average. Ideas from the theory of critical phenomena together with numerical insights allow to study such systems by performing a cyclic sequence of qualitative exploration, theory formulation and numerical testing of the analytical predictions.

The research on this topic started in [my master's thesis](downloads/masterthesis.pdf){:target="_blank"} by studying two flavours of the **linear sum assignment problem**, the **random assignment problem** and the **Euclidean bipartite matching problem**. You can find more output on [the relevant page](/publications).
