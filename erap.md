 <ins>In brief</ins>: given \\( 2n \\) points, \\(n\\) “reds” and \\(n\\) “blues” in a Euclidean space, solving the associated Euclidean Assignment Problem consists in finding the bijection between red and blue points that minimizes a functional of the point positions (an example instance at \\(n=500\\) on the unit square is depicted in figure). In the simplest stochastic version of this problem, the points are a Poisson Point Process, and some interest has developed over the years on the typical properties of the solution in the limit \\( n \to \infty \\) depending on the dimension of the ambient space and choice of cost function, motivated (among others) by an analogy with the physics of low-dimensional disordered systems and by recent results in Functional Analysis on the Monge–Kantorovich problem in the continuum.
